# Beginners Pointüñ•Ô∏èüìö

Beginners Point is an e-Learning website . This model is the beginning of real free education for all levels which
provides free resources and an online compiler to practice programming languages.It‚Äôs a free to use, simple and fast platform to learn concepts in C Language (as of now) and the future modifications are to be done. 

There are basic chapters of C Programming language, which will definitely help users to gain in depth knowledge, through high quality content, collected and provided by us in the website.

Mostly in websites users have to take subscription for accessing full notes and all, but our motto is free knowledge for all hence we are never going to take any subscription fees for this website. Here, we have integrated a free compiler as well so that users can practice coding, while learning.

We have made the User Interface very easy to use. Our website‚Äôs most notable feature is that it‚Äôs completely ad-free, making it less annoying and distractive. We have made our website completely responsive for seamless experience across all devices.
